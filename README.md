Updates 2023: heroku is deprecated, OpenAI translated the game into English

P.s. Sorry, but I will never do timed tasks again ðŸ˜€

P.s.s. My exposure to React.js was quite limited, hence,
a significant portion of the allocated time was spent on consulting the documentation.

P.s.s.s. Really, 3 hours. You can check commits time.
